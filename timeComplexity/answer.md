Here are the answers with the space and time complexity for each problem:

---

1. **Sum of Array Elements:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) – One loop runs through the entire array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) – Only a single variable (`sum`) is used for storing the result.

---

2. **Factorial using Recursion:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) – The function makes `n` recursive calls.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) – Due to recursive call stack.

---

3. **Reverse a String:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) – One loop iterates over the string.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) – A new string of the same size is created to store the reversed string.

---

4. **Find Maximum Element in Array:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) – A single loop runs through the entire array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) – Only one variable (`max`) is used.

---

5. **Binary Search:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(log n) – The array is repeatedly halved.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the iterative version, O(log n) for the recursive version (due to the call stack).

---

6. **Check if Array is Sorted:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) – The function checks every pair of adjacent elements.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) – No additional data structures are used.

---

7. **Fibonacci using Recursion:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(2^n) – Due to repeated recursive calls for the same values.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) – The maximum depth of the recursive stack is `n`.

---

8. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n + m) – Both arrays are iterated through once.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) – A new array of size `n + m` is created.

---

9. **Bubble Sort:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) – Two nested loops traverse the array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) – Sorting happens in-place with no extra memory used.

---

10. **Find Duplicates in Array:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) – One loop goes through the array, and each insertion/check in the object is O(1).
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) – An object (`seen`) is used to store elements.
