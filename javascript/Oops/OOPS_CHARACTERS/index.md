### Characteristics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that contain both data and methods. The four main characteristics of OOP are **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.

#### 1. Classes and Objects
- **English**: A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the object will have. An object is an instance of a class, and memory is only allocated when an object is created.
  
- **Hinglish**: Class ek blueprint ya template hota hai jisse objects banaye jaate hain. Yeh define karta hai object ke attributes aur methods ko. Object ek class ka instance hota hai aur memory tabhi allocate hoti hai jab object create kiya jaata hai.

#### 2. Encapsulation
- **English**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It restricts direct access to some parts of an object, often by making attributes private. This ensures data security and allows controlled access via methods.
  
- **Hinglish**: Encapsulation ka matlab hai data aur methods ko ek class ke andar bandhna. Yeh object ke kuch parts tak direct access rokta hai, jaise attributes ko private banana. Isse data secure rehta hai aur controlled access methods ke zariye diya jaata hai.

#### 3. Inheritance
- **English**: Inheritance is the mechanism where one class (child class) inherits the properties and methods of another class (parent class). This helps in reusing code and allows child classes to add new functionality or override the inherited methods.
  
- **Hinglish**: Inheritance ek mechanism hai jisme ek class (child class) doosri class (parent class) ke properties aur methods inherit karti hai. Isse code reuse karne ka mauka milta hai aur child class apni functionality add kar sakti hai ya inherited methods ko override kar sakti hai.

#### 4. Polymorphism
- **English**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It enables methods to behave differently depending on the object calling them, thus adding flexibility to the code.
  
- **Hinglish**: Polymorphism ka matlab hai ki alag classes ke objects ko ek jaise treat kiya jaaye agar unke pass common interface ho. Yeh methods ko alag-alag tareeke se behave karne ki ability deta hai, jis object ne unhe call kiya ho, isse code mein flexibility aati hai.

#### 5. Abstraction
- **English**: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the complex details of a system and showing only the relevant parts. This allows users to interact with the system without worrying about its internal workings. In OOP, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes.
  
- **Hinglish**: Abstraction ka matlab hai system ke complex details ko chhupa kar sirf important parts dikhana. Isse users bina internal workings ko samjhe system ke saath interact kar sakte hain. OOP mein abstraction abstract classes ke through achieve hota hai.

### Summary of OOP Characteristics

| Characteristic      | **English Description**                                     | **Hinglish Description**                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Class & Object**   | A class is a blueprint, and objects are instances of it    | Class ek blueprint hota hai, aur objects uske instances hote hain |
| **Encapsulation**    | Bundling data and methods, ensuring data security          | Data aur methods ko bandhna, aur data security ensure karna |
| **Inheritance**      | Child classes inherit from parent classes                  | Child class parent class ke properties aur methods ko inherit karti hai |
| **Polymorphism**     | Same method behaves differently based on the object        | Same method alag objects ke liye alag tareeke se behave karti hai |
| **Abstraction**      | Hiding complexity, showing only necessary features         | Complexity chhupa kar sirf zaroori features dikhana |
