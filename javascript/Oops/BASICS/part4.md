Got it! Let's avoid using `name` and `age` in the `Person` constructor or class. I'll walk through the examples, explaining `call`, `apply`, constructor functions, classes, and inheritance, without using `name` or `age` in the `Person` class or constructor.

---

### 1. **`call` and `apply` Methods**

The `call` and `apply` methods are used to invoke a function with a specific `this` context, passing parameters directly in the case of `call` or as an array for `apply`.

Example with a simple object:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  console.log(this);
  console.log(a + b);
}

let obj = {
  title: "xyz",
  status: "active"
};

// Using call
sum.call(obj, 2, 3);  // Output: obj, 5

// Using apply
sum.apply(obj, [2, 3]);  // Output: obj, 5
```

---

### 2. **Using `call` and `apply` in Constructor Functions**

You can use `call` and `apply` within constructor functions to reuse functionality from one constructor in another.

```javascript
function SetTitle(title) {
  this.title = title;
}

function UserDetails(title, id, address) {
  SetTitle.apply(this, [title]);  // Reuse SetTitle constructor
  this.id = id;
  this.address = address;
}

let user1 = new UserDetails("Developer", 12345, "Street ABC");
console.log(user1);
// Output: UserDetails { title: 'Developer', id: 12345, address: 'Street ABC' }
```

---

### 3. **Classes and Constructor**

Using ES6 classes makes object creation and inheritance simpler and cleaner.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(title, level) {
    this.title = title;
    this.level = level;
    // Function defined inside constructor, attached to every instance
    this.getTitle = () => {
      console.log(this.title);
    };
  }

  // Function defined outside constructor, added to the prototype
  updateLevel() {
    this.level += 1;
  }
}

let user = new User("Developer", 3);
user.getTitle();  // Output: Developer
user.updateLevel();
console.log(user.level);  // Output: 4
```

> **Note**: Methods defined inside the constructor are attached to every instance. Methods outside the constructor are added to the prototype.

---

### 4. **Inheritance in JavaScript Classes with `extends` and `super`**

You can use `extends` to create a subclass and `super` to call the parent class's constructor.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(canFly, canSwim) {
    this.canFly = canFly;
    this.canSwim = canSwim;
    this.visibility = true;
  }

  toggleVisibility() {
    this.visibility = !this.visibility;
    console.log(this.visibility);
  }
}

class Teacher extends Person {
  constructor(canFly, canSwim, salary) {
    super(canFly, canSwim);  // Call the parent constructor
    this.salary = salary;
  }
}

let teacher1 = new Teacher(false, true, 4000);
console.log(teacher1);  
// Output: Teacher { canFly: false, canSwim: true, visibility: true, salary: 4000 }
```

---

### 5. **Prototypes and Constructor Functions vs Classes**

Using constructor functions and prototypes is the traditional way to create objects and inherit properties before the ES6 class syntax. Letâ€™s compare the approaches.

#### Constructor Function Approach:
```javascript
function Person(canFly, canSwim) {
  this.canFly = canFly;
  this.canSwim = canSwim;
  this.visibility = true;
}

Person.prototype.toggleVisibility = function() {
  this.visibility = !this.visibility;
  console.log(this.visibility);
};

function Teacher(canFly, canSwim, salary) {
  Person.call(this, canFly, canSwim);  // Call Person constructor
  this.salary = salary;
}

Teacher.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Teacher.prototype.constructor = Teacher;

let teacher1 = new Teacher(false, true, 4000);
console.log(teacher1);
```

### 6. **Comparison: Constructor Function vs Class Syntax**

| **Constructor Function** | **Class Syntax** |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Uses function constructors and prototypes. | Introduced in ES6, uses class syntax. |
| `call` and `apply` are used to inherit properties. | `extends` and `super` are used to inherit properties. |
| Functions inside the constructor are attached to each instance. | Methods inside the constructor are also attached to each instance. |
| Functions outside the constructor (added to prototype) are shared among instances. | Methods outside the constructor are added to the class's prototype. |

---

#### Example: Constructor Function Approach
```javascript
function Person(canFly, canSwim) {
  this.canFly = canFly;
  this.canSwim = canSwim;
}

Person.prototype.toggleVisibility = function() {
  this.visibility = !this.visibility;
  console.log(this.visibility);
};

function Teacher(canFly, canSwim, salary) {
  Person.call(this, canFly, canSwim);  // Call Person constructor
  this.salary = salary;
}

Teacher.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Teacher.prototype.constructor = Teacher;
```

#### Example: Class Syntax Approach
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(canFly, canSwim) {
    this.canFly = canFly;
    this.canSwim = canSwim;
    this.visibility = true;
  }

  toggleVisibility() {
    this.visibility = !this.visibility;
    console.log(this.visibility);
  }
}

class Teacher extends Person {
  constructor(canFly, canSwim, salary) {
    super(canFly, canSwim);  // Calls the parent constructor
    this.salary = salary;
  }
}
```
